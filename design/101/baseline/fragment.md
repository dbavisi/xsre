# Fragments defined in the Baseline
The Fragments defined in the Baseline expand upon the Fragment core component, providing specific guidelines tailored to common use cases.

Refer to the [xsre.design/101.core.fragment](../core/fragment.md) for an understanding of Fragments.

## NumericFragment
The NumericFragment is a specialized Fragment designed to handle numeric data types. It supports the following additional features:

- Compatibility with arithmetic types, ensuring flexibility in numeric computations.
- Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## BufferFragment
The BufferFragment is a specialized Fragment designed to handle binary data. It supports the following additional features:

- Compatibility with binary data types, ensuring flexibility in binary data handling.
- Buffer operations: Read, write, and manipulate binary data efficiently.

## ArrayFragment
The ArrayFragment is a specialized Fragment designed to handle array data types. It supports the following additional features:

- Compatibility with array data types, ensuring flexibility in array handling.
- Array operations: Access, modify, and manipulate array elements efficiently.
- Support for multi-dimensional arrays, enabling complex computations.
