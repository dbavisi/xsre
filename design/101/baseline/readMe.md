## Abstract
The Baseline serves as a set of foundational guidelines for implementing generic interfaces and components within the xsre system. While adherence to these guidelines is not mandatory, they provide a reference for achieving consistency and interoperability across different implementations.

Refer to the [Appendix: Revisions](#appendix-revisions) for a summary of updates to this document.

# Purpose
The xsre Baseline aims to establish a common framework for implementing components and processes in the xsre system. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that their implementations align with the overall architecture and design principles of xsre.

# Guidelines

## Generic Interfaces
The Baseline defines generic interfaces for key components. These interfaces specify the expected behavior and interactions, enabling seamless integration of custom implementations.

## Core Components
The Baseline provides recommendations for implementing core components.

## Optional Enhancements
The Baseline also outlines optional enhancements that can improve functionality and performance:
- Compression: Techniques for reducing storage space.
- Encryption: Methods for securing data during storage and retrieval.
- Versioning: Strategies for tracking changes to data over time.
- Metadata: Approaches for attaching additional context or information to data.
- Indexing: Techniques for improving retrieval performance.
