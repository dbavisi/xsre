## Abstract
The Baseline serves as a set of foundational guidelines for implementing generic interfaces and components within the xsre system. While adherence to these guidelines is not mandatory, these provide a reference for achieving consistency and interoperability across different implementations.

Refer to the [Appendix: Revisions](#appendix-revisions) for a summary of updates to this document.

# Purpose
The Baseline aims to establish a common framework for implementing components and processes in the xsre system. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that their implementations align with the overall architecture and design principles of the xsre system.

# Guidelines

## Generic Interfaces
The Baseline defines generic interfaces for key components. These interfaces specify the expected behavior and interactions, enabling seamless integration of custom implementations.

Such interfaces are often implemented using Agnostic patterns, providing flexibility and adaptability to various use cases and storage solutions, allowing developers to create components that can work with different backends without being tightly coupled to a specific architecture.

<!-- ToDo: Document the Agnostic patterns. -->
<!-- Refer to the [xsre.design/101.agnostic.readMe](../agnostic/readMe.md) for more information on the Agnostic patterns. -->

## Core Components
The Baseline provides recommendations for implementing core components.

Refer to the [xsre.design/101.readMe](../readMe.md) for an overview of the core components and their roles within the xsre system.

## Optional Enhancements
The Baseline also outlines optional enhancements that can improve functionality and performance:
- Compression: Techniques for reducing storage space.
- Encryption: Methods for securing data during storage and retrieval.
- Versioning: Strategies for tracking changes to data over time.
- Metadata: Approaches for attaching additional context or information to data.
- Indexing: Techniques for improving retrieval performance.
