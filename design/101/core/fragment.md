## Abstract
This document provides a comprehensive overview of Fragments within the xsre system, outlining their characteristics and detailing the Fragments defined in the xsre Baseline. It serves as a foundational reference for understanding the role and utilization of Fragments in the xsre architecture.

Refer to the [Appendix: Revisions](#appendix-revisions) for a summary of updates to this document.

# Introduction
In the xsre system, a Fragment is a basic storage unit supported by the underlying storage solution. It is necessary to ensure that an Item can be represented as a series of such Fragments to facilitate storage and retrieval.

The xsre system imposes no strict constraints on the definition of a Fragment, provided that the Keeper can effectively manage it.

## Essential Characteristics
Fragments in the xsre system exhibit the following essential characteristics:

### Storage, Retrieval, Modification, and Deletion
- Storage: The Keeper must be capable of storing the Fragment in the underlying storage solution.
- Retrieval: The Keeper must be able to retrieve the Fragment from the storage solution.
- Modification: The Keeper must support modifying the Fragment within the storage solution.
- Deletion: The Keeper must facilitate the deletion of the Fragment from the storage solution.

### Serialization and Deserialization
- Serialization: The Keeper must enable the serialization of an Item into its corresponding Fragments.
- Deserialization: The Keeper must support the deserialization of Fragments back into the corresponding Item.

## Optional Characteristics
Fragments may also exhibit optional characteristics, which are not strictly required but can enhance functionality:

- Compression: The Keeper may support compressing the Fragment to optimize storage space.
- Encryption: The Keeper may provide encryption capabilities for securing the Fragment during storage and retrieval.
- Versioning: The Keeper may implement versioning for Fragments to track changes over time.
- Metadata: The Keeper may allow the attachment of metadata to Fragments for additional context or information.
- Indexing: The Keeper may support indexing of Fragments to improve retrieval performance.

# Baseline
The xsre system does not impose any mandates on the implementation of core components or processes apart from the operational requirements of the system.

For general usability, Baseline provides a set of guidelines pertaining to the implementation of generic interfaces and components. Adherence to these guidelines is not mandatory.

See the [xsre.design/101.baseline.readMe](../baseline/readMe.md) for a detailed overview of the Baseline.

## Fragments defined in the Baseline
The following Fragments are defined in the Baseline:

- NumericFragment: A specialized Fragment designed to handle numeric data types.

See the [xsre.design/101.baseline.fragment](../baseline/fragment.md) for a detailed overview of the Fragments defined in the Baseline.
